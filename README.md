<h1>E-Learning platform</h1>

This is an E-Learning platform project developed using Spring Boot and microservices. The main objective of this project is to provide an intuitive and user-friendly platform for educational institutions, teachers, and students to manage online teaching and learning.

The project is divided into several independent microservices, each with its specific responsibility, such as user management, course management, assessment management, and payment management. This makes the system highly scalable and easy to maintain, allowing new features to be added without affecting other microservices.

The system also includes features such as customized user profiles, student progress monitoring, online assessments, and payments. Additionally, there is integration with other E-Learning tools such as Moodle and Blackboard.

The technology used to develop this project includes Spring Boot, Spring Security, Spring Data JPA, Netflix Eureka, Zuul Gateway, and RabbitMQ.
